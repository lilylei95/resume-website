    I had worked on many projects, and one of bigger one is called
    Covention Logistic Tracker(CLT). I had work on CLT during my senior
    year at Univery Nevada, Las Vegas. CLT is to provide the event
    organizers, exhibitors, and regular convention visitors an easier
    way to edit, and view the event information easily.

    CLT is consist of two different appliation, one application is a web
    application where users can sign in to access booth or event
    information. The one is an phone application for the a regular
    convention visitor. The web application is used by the event
    organizer and exhibitors to edit their event information or booth
    information. The phone application uses this information that is
    entered by the event organizer and exhibitors and present it to the
    vistor.

    For the project, I worked on the backend portion. I created API
    calls using Python. These API are made based on business
    requirements that is needed for the applciation. The project used
    SQL to get information from the database. There also some API calls
    needed to use third-party API, such as imagur in order to upload for
    us to upload photos for logos.
